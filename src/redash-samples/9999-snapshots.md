heading: Comic issue counts by GCD data dump since 2015
blurb: It is great to see how the database has grown through the years!<br/><br/><span class="note">A note about the first part of the WHERE clause -- since the snapshot is a date integer in YYYYMMDD format, the <code>% 10000</code> modulo is a convenient way to look just at the month and day. <code>201</code> is February 1, and <code>801</code> is August 1. Presto would need a large amount of memory to load in 24 snapshots a year for 9+ years. Using a subset of snapshots allows the query to stay within memory limits.</span>
